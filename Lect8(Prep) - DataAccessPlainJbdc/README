Study the supplied source files for a simple Java JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) application.
JDBC basically allows an application to work with a relational database. The supplied code is a
simple and partial implementation of a database application that manages contact details.

1. Each of the supplied classes and interface has a key responsibility. Suggest what it might be.

2. Consider interface com.aucklanduni.jdbc.dao.ContactDao. DAO stands for Data Access Object. What do
   you think might be the value of having this DAO interface? Other than the supplied implementation
   (com.aucklanduni.jdbc.dao.PlainContactDao), what other implementations could there be?
   
3. Study class PlainContactDao. Make some observations based on its implementation.
